                        <p class="projectPara">Every app I developed before this one was a web app, so the goal for this project was to try something
                            a little different. Prior to finalizing my decision, I did a little research and discovered that the original Microsoft
                            Solitaire was programmed by an intern with arguably too much time on his hands back in 1988.<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/13/15285780/windows-solitaire-original-bored-intern" style="color: rgb(31, 31, 255);">*</a>
                            However, despite the fact that it was only a game, the program was eventually even endorsed by Bill Gates himself. 
                            If it's good enough for a Microsoft intern, I figured it would provide more than a sufficient enough challenge for me. 
                            And so that's exactly what I did - I developed my own version of Window's Solitaire using Microsoft's XNA framework.

                                    Development on this started out pretty slow. If you've never programmed a game before, it's kind of a different beast
                                    to tame compared to web apps. First of all, the game engine updates itself ideally at a rate of 60 times per second. 
                                    This lends itself well to drawing animations on the screen, but it can be pretty confusing at first understanding that
                                    the program will check 60 times a second to see if, for example, two game objects have come into contact with each other

                                    There were several takeaways from this one. First and foremost, was that while it is difficult to envision what a program 
                                    will end up looking like for someone without much experience, it's important to research and try to define an organizational 
                                    structure for the program before you start coding. I ended up having to refactor a lot of code as I went along because I didn't

                                    The next takeaway is to make sure to follow the Single-Responsibilty principle of SOLID OOP. Though the principle is easy to 
                                    understand in theory, one class has one responsibility, in practice things can spiral into spaghetti fairly quickly without taking
                                    the time to back-up and look at the big picture. For example, when I first started writing this program, I put almost all of the deck
                                    logic into the Card class. It seemed logical at the time to put it there, but soon the class became about more than just managing 
                                    a card object, it was also responsible for logic concerning the deck in play and the overall flow of the game. Needless to say, it 
                                    became very bloated very fast. About halfway into development, I decided to refactor this class and split it to put the deck logic 
                                    and game system logic in their own classes, and the Card class handled logic only for interactions with a single Card object. Things 
                                    became much simpler after that.
